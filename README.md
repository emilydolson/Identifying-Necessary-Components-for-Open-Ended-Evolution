This repository contains code, analysis, and data for the paper 
"The MODES toolbox: Measurements of Open-ended Dynamics in Evolving Systems"
by [Emily Dolson](emilyldolson.com), [Anya Vostinar](https://vostinar.sites.grinnell.edu/), 
[Michael Wiser](https://msu.edu/~mwiser/) and [Charles Ofria](ofria.com). In this paper, we present 
a toolbox of measurements for quantifying hallmarks of open-ended evolution and test them in two systems:
NK Landscapes and Avida.

## Contents of this repository

- **Paper**: This where all of the latex code for the paper itself lives
- **Data**: This directory contains two csv files, one containing the nk landscape data (`nk_data.csv`) and one containing the Avida data (`avida_data.csv`). It also contains a markdown file explaining the columns.
- **Analysis**: This directory contains an R-markdown file with all of the analysis code (and a little commentary), a version of the R-markdown file rendered to html (linked to above as supplmentary material), and a script for making flat violin plots (required for the rain cloud plots).
- **Figs**: This directory contains the figures generated by the code in `analysis` so that the code in `paper` can access them.
